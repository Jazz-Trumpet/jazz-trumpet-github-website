When I was young I made a promise to myself that I would become a great Trumpet player.
I really admired jazz giants like Louis Armstrong, Clifford Brown, and Miles Davis, all
accomplished horn players.

Now, I find myself in a warzone of music. It feels like a mad race to make intriguing
and original music. I enjoy every chance that I get to record or play in front of people.

It was not always like this. Music is difficult to master and I had to be persistent about learning.
To those people who want to focus on music I say get familiar with intervals, scales, chords, inversions, and the circle of fifths.

Intervals:
-----------

Understanding intervals and how to make them is essential for musicians.  

what is a major 2nd from C?
the note D, which can also be said to be a Major 9th away from C.
 - This is because there are 7 notes in a scale with the notes after being repeat. the first is also the 8th, the 2nd is also the 9th, and so on.

How about a 4th from E?
- the note A, Which is also called the 11th

Knowing what the interval is between two notes is crucial for learning music by ear.
Music is also TRANSPOSED by re-centering around a different key and preserving the intervals.

Scales:
---------
You will notice that intervals between notes becomes octaves, therefore repeats, after the so-called 7th. This is because scales in music have 7 notes.

The major scale can be considered the base scale in Western Music. Students are encouraged to learn all 12 possible Major scales, one for each note in the chromatic scale.

Music Educators are encouraging you to learn these major scales and master them well because learning them is the key to learning other types of scales.
A major scale becomes a minor scale if you start on the 2nd, 3rd, or 6th note.
These are modes of a major scale, and are easily learned when enough time is dedicated to learning thee major scale.
