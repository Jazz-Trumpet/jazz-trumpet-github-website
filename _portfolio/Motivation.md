Getting up in the morning is hard, but maintaining a constant energy
of optimism and positivity throughout the day can feel impossible for many.

At times, one may feel particularly helpless or in anxiety about what to do.


If you ever feel this way, look back and think about your habits.
Habits are small enough to go unnoticed but powerful enough to take over your mood, health,
performance, and endurance.


Even though habits may be small, taking control of them
is your first step into becoming a successful person.

For Example:
-------
If your goal is to stop eating sweets AND lose weight,
you would track the number of times you thought about eating sweets - if you eat sweets,
put a mark on the calendar that you ate them and a note of how much. When you track
your habits over time like this, you are reminding yourself of the conviction you made to live healthy.





If you thought this article was helpful, I suggest reading The Power of Habit, A very fine read about
how individuals and society are powered by habits.
