Getting up in the morning is hard, but maintaining a constant energy
of optimism and positivity throughout the day can feel impossible for many.
At times, one may feel particularly helpless or in anxiety about what to do.


If you ever feel this way, look back and think about your habits. Habits are
small enough to go unnoticed but powerful enough to take over your mood, health,
performance, and endurance.


Consider them deeply. Even though habits may be small, taking control of them
is your first step into becoming a successful person.
