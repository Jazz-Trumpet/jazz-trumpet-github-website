Making stickers at home brings the delight of materializing your creations and distributing them
unto the world.

You'll love or hate the appeal of home cut, home printed stickers. At the very least, it can be a rewarding learning experience.

Here is how I started making stickers at home and how you can too!

- Note: Its not cheap to make stickers at home. The more you invest, the higher quality sticker you can achieve.
The downside is not making a profit.
If you want to make a profit, I suggest using companies such as StickerMule. They have experts and equipment that cost fortunes to have. They can make you large amounts of excellent stickers for a considerably low price.

## Equipment
Again, I am suggesting to leave the production of stickers to the experts.

If you are anything like me though, you might have already bought some of the equipment that can
cut stickers for you on a grid. Having something like a Cricut machine is not a bad thing if you are a creative person.
With this machine, you can make Tee-Shirts, postcards, simple and elegant crafts quickly and immediately.


You have to consider whether or not you want to outsource the sticker production
